## Welcome to my New Website!

So my new website has now been launched! This website has been designed and developed by Fran Haines who has worked to get across my own style and brand. I'm really happy with the turn-out as it means I'm now able to display my work and update my blog as and when I like, so keep an eye out! 

If you have any feedback or have questions about advice for photography in general, comment them and I will write posts giving my best tips and advice. A photography advice section is for sure going to be something I work on.

Let me know what you think of the new site in the comments section. 

Best Wishes,
Emma
